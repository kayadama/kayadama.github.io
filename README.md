This site is a portfolio of some of my technical work. It is a work in progress, and will be updated slowly over time. 

I am currently a graduate student in applied economics at Boston College. I expect to graduate with a M.S. in December 2021. Broadly speaking, my interests are in using the abundance of tools for statistical inference in order to better understand the world through financial data. Practically, this takes many forms. I am a very curious person by nature and my interests are not set in stone. 

#### Resume

My resume can be found [here](https://github.com/kayadama/resume/blob/main/bcrist_resume.pdf). 

#### ST-project
In [this project](https://kayadama.github.io/st-project/ "ST-project"), I use R to aggregate and plot regional demographic data and state level data about liquor sales. This project was for a course in my first semester of grad school.
